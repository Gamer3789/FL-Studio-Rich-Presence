# I would like to say, this entire thing's actually generated by ChatGPT. I just prompted the features and made sure they worked properly.
# REQUIREMENTS: pypresence, win32gui (pywin32), and psutil (All of which can be installed via "pip install [library name]")
Before you can use the Rich Presence, you must first create an application ID through the Discord Developer Portal.

You're going to want to upload an asset image, which should be the FL Studio icon of your choosing. I'd recommend grabbing a PNG, uploading it, and naming it "flstudio10" (Because that's the name of the image in the Python file itself)

Here's the important part: Fetching your application ID. You'll want to open up the fruityrichpresence.py file in a text editor and paste that in.

# After this, you should be good to go. You can run this in Python itself or in Windows PowerShell by running the following commands:
"cd C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\LocationOfPythonFile\"
And then:
"python fruityrichpresence.py"
